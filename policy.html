            <h1><strong>our policies</strong></h1>
            <ol>
                <li>All staff members are expected to greet guests with a warm welcome, provide attentive service, and maintain a positive attitude throughout their dining experience. Orders will be processed efficiently, and wait times for food and beverages will be kept to a minimum. If delays occur, customers will be informed immediately. We value guest feedback and encourage customers to share their dining experiences. Feedback forms are available at the front desk, or guests can contact us online for any suggestions or concerns.</li>

                <li>For groups of 6 or more, reservations are required to ensure sufficient seating and preparation. Customers are asked to cancel or modify their reservation at least 24 hours in advance to avoid a no-show fee. We welcome walk-in customers, though reservations are recommended during peak hours or weekends.</li>
                
                <li>Guests with food allergies must inform their server before ordering so we can take appropriate precautions. We accommodate special dietary requirements (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, vegan), and modifications to menu items can be made upon request. While we take precautions, cross-contamination is always possible in a shared kitchen environment. Please consult with your server for further details.</li>
                
                <li>A special kids' menu with smaller portions and child-friendly options is available. High chairs and booster seats are available for families with young children, subject to availability. Parents or guardians are responsible for ensuring that children are supervised and behave appropriately while in the restaurant.</li>
                
                <li>We accept all major credit/debit cards, mobile payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay), and cash. A service charge of 18% will be added for parties of 6 or more. Additional tips are always appreciated for excellent service. We happily accommodate bill splitting, though it may take additional time to process multiple payments.</li>
                
                <li>All customers ordering alcoholic beverages must provide valid identification confirming they are at least 21 years old. We reserve the right to refuse alcohol service to guests who are intoxicated or disruptive. Alcoholic beverages will be served until 30 minutes before closing.</li>
                
                <li>Tipping is encouraged but not mandatory. A recommended tip of 15-20% is suggested based on the service quality. A mandatory service charge of 18% is applied to all bills for large groups (6 or more).</li>
                
                <li> We maintain high standards of cleanliness and hygiene in both front and back-of-house areas. All employees must adhere to safety protocols, including regular handwashing and sanitizing surfaces. We follow local health guidelines and adjust our policies to ensure customer and employee safety, including mask-wearing, social distancing, and enhanced cleaning procedures as necessary. The restaurant undergoes regular health inspections, and all kitchen staff hold the necessary food handling certifications.</li>
                
                <li> We allow pets in our outdoor seating areas, provided they are kept on a leash and well-behaved. Service animals are always welcome inside the restaurant. Owners are responsible for cleaning up after their pets and ensuring they do not disturb other guests.</li>
                
                <li>We offer private dining options and event space for special occasions. Reservations for private events require a minimum spend or deposit. A cancellation fee applies to events canceled within 48 hours of the scheduled time. We offer customized menus for private events to meet dietary needs and preferences.</li>
            </ol>
